<p><h2>MS-Word (Word Processor)</h2></p>
<p>Introduction: MS-Word is a text editing or word processing software developed by Microsoft Corporation, USA under the MS-Office package. Word processing refers to the use of computers to create, edit, and print documents. A word processor enables us to create a document, store it electronically in a disk, display it on a screen, modify it by entering commands and characters from the keyboard, and print it on a printer. MS-Word is a Windows-based application, and it has many powerful and advanced features to manipulate the document. With the help of this program, we can create any types of documents like letters, reports, thesis, manuals, brochures, advertisements, and many other documents. Besides creating, editing, and modifying documents, MS-Word provides some special facilities such as checking spelling and grammatical errors, searching for synonyms and antonyms, working with columns, tables, special symbols, pictures, graphs, charts, and many more. The document created with MS-Word has a “.doc” extension. The newer version of MS-Word has a newer extension “.docx”.</p>

<p><strong>e. OLE (Object Linking and Embedding):</strong> OLE is a technology used to share information between programs through objects. Objects are saved entities of different types like charts, equations, pictures, audio and video files, etc.</p>
<p><strong>f. Mail merge:</strong> Mail merge is a useful tool that will allow us to easily produce multiple letters, labels, envelopes, and more using information stored in a list, database, or spreadsheet.</p>
<p><strong>g. Searching:</strong> MS-Word allows us to search any word or text and replace or delete it with other necessary ones throughout the entire document.</p>
<p><strong>h. Printing:</strong> MS-Word allows users to print the documents created by the user anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>i. Formatting a document:</strong> Word has various tools to help format a document.

We can search and replace, display a ruler, change paragraph alignment, change line spacing, create bullets and numbering to show information in a list. To further enhance the appearance of the text and documents, we can add borders and shading. We can even add a watermark to denote some confidential information in a document.</p>
