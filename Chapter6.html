<p><strong>Introduction to the Internet</strong></p>
<p>Internet is the global network of networks. Or it is a huge collection of computers all over the world that are inter-connected to one another in various ways to form a web-net.</p>

<p><strong>Components required for Internet Connections:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>A TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) enabled computer with web browser.</li>
    <li>An account with an ISP (Internet Service Provider).</li>
    <li>A telephone line.</li>
    <li>A MODEM to connect to the telephone line and computer.</li>
    <li>A set of computer with the following capacity:
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum 386 microprocessor chip with 16 MB RAM.</li>
            <li>Color monitor with 256 color support and 640x480 resolution.</li>
            <li>A hard disk with 200 MB of free space.</li>
            <li>Multimedia sound card and speaker.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Internet Services and Applications</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>World Wide Web (WWW):</strong> WWW is a series of services that are interconnected through hypertext. It was created in 1990 by the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, to exchange and share data through the Internet using the protocol known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</li>
    <li><strong>Web Browser:</strong> A web browser is a computer program that accesses web pages and displays them on a computer screen. Popular web browsers include Internet Explorer, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and others.</li>
    <li><strong>FTP - File Transfer Protocol:</strong> FTP is a tool that permits an Internet user to move or transfer a file from one computer to another. The files may contain data, graphics, text, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Electronic Mail (E-mail):</strong> E-mail is the most widely used feature on the Internet for sending and receiving messages electronically, which can include a variety of digital text, graphics, video, animation, and audio data.</li>
    <li><strong>Voicemail:</strong> Voicemail is a service offered by specialized hardware and software that answers telephone calls and records audio messages.</li>
    <li><strong>USENET - View and News:</strong> USENET is the Bulletin Board Service (BBS) of the Internet, where messages are organized into thousands of newsgroups covering specific areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Chat:</strong> Chat is a service that allows real-time communication by typing. It is a quick and easy way to exchange information and ideas, with offline messages available if the person is not online.</li>
    <li><strong>IRC - Internet Relay Chat:</strong> IRC is a multi-user live chat facility. Major IRC servers around the world are linked, and anyone can create a channel to chat with others.</li>
    <li><strong>Video Conferencing:</strong> Video conferencing, also known as webcam chatting, enables direct face-to-face communication across networks and provides real-time visual communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Universal Resource Locator (URL):</strong> A URL is a unique address that identifies the location of a resource on the Internet. It consists of the protocol (http), host computer name (www), domain name (animalplanet), and domain type (com).</li>
    <li><strong>E-Fax (Electronic Fax):</strong> E-Fax allows sending and receiving faxes directly on a computer. It functions similarly to E-mail, where messages go to an Internet server and are then forwarded to the destination.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Introduction to HTML</strong></p>
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which is used to create web pages for the internet. HTML files are text files that contain several tags and attributes. It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee, based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). HTML uses these tags and attributes to organize and display content on a web browser. The versions of HTML include HTML, HTML+, HTML 1.0, HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01, and HTML 5.0.</p>

<p><strong>Use of HTML:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is used to create the basic layout or design of a web page.</li>
    <li>Without HTML, the worldwide web wouldn't exist.</li>
    <li>It allows embedding images, videos, audio, etc.</li>
    <li>It enables customization and formatting of characters, such as bold, italic, and underline.</li>
    <li>It helps create links and lists.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages of HTML:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is easy to use, flexible, and user-friendly.</li>
    <li>It is supported by all web browsers and operating systems like Macintosh, Windows, Unix, etc.</li>
    <li>It is easy to obtain and modify content.</li>
    <li>It is compatible with all search engines.</li>
    <li>HTML 5.0 introduces several new and advanced features.</li>
    <li>HTML files load quickly.</li>
    <li>Many tutorials are available for learning HTML.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of HTML:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>It is difficult to create attractive and interactive web pages only with HTML. Other technologies like PHP, JavaScript, and SQL are often required.</li>
    <li>It cannot create dynamic web pages.</li>
    <li>It is a markup language, not a programming language.</li>
    <li>There are many inconsistencies and compatibility issues with HTML.</li>
    <li>There is no fully accepted standard for HTML.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>HTML Tags</strong></p>
<p>HTML tags are instructions or commands given to the web browser to organize text, images, and other components of web pages. These tags are executed by the web browser to render content. Tags are written inside angular brackets &lt;&gt;. There are two types of HTML tags: opening tags and closing tags.</p>

<p><strong>DBMS (Database Management System)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> Data refers to raw facts and figures. They are isolated and uninterpreted until processed. For example, Ram, 19, 12, Pokhara.</p>
<p><strong>Information:</strong> Information is the meaningful result obtained after processing data. For example, "Ram is a student, 19 years old, who lives in Pokhara-12."</p>

<p>Databases are organized collections of data, designed to store and process information quickly and efficiently. A Database Management System (DBMS) helps manage this data. Examples include MS Access, MySQL, Oracle, and dBase.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages/Features/Importance of DBMS:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Quick and easy data retrieval.</li>
    <li>Reduces data redundancy.</li>
    <li>Allows data sharing over a network.</li>
    <li>Improves data security and privacy.</li>
    <li>Helps reduce data inconsistency.</li>
    <li>Provides an organized way to store data.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of DBMS:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Higher installation and operating costs.</li>
    <li>Requires more disk space.</li>
    <li>Potential security and privacy issues.</li>
    <li>Requires technical manpower (DBA) for maintenance and operation.</li>
</ul>
