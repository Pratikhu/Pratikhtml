<p><h2>Introduction:</h2></p>
<p>As we know, every computerized device does not work by itself. They need to be given some sort of command that makes the computer work. These commands help to instruct the computer and program specific actions required by the user. Since the commands are given in the form of a computer language, we need programming languages to write the set of instructions which command the computer to perform certain actions, collectively called programs. These programs are again integrated in order to make a complete software. Simply, software is the collection of different interrelated programs which perform specific functions.</p>
<p>Programs written in any type of programming language are not understood by the computer, hence we need some sort of language translator or processor such as assembler, compiler, and interpreter, which have the basic function of converting programs written in any type of language into machine-level language.</p>
<p>The program written by the programmer is known as the source program. After converting it becomes a program.</p>

<p><h2>Qualities of Good Programs:</h2></p>
<p>It should be easily understood.</p>
<p>A program should be correct; it should be error-free.</p>
<p>It should be reliable.</p>
<p>It should have an easily understandable user interface.</p>
<p>It should be portable and flexible.</p>

<p><h2>Programming Language:</h2></p>
<p>In order to make communication between the user and the computer, we need a computer language that helps the user to generate commands to perform as per the requirement. This language, with which we can give instructions to the computer, is known as a programming language. Programming languages are a set of different keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other entities using different character sets, including numbers, special symbols, and alphanumeric values.</p>
<p>Hence, the process of writing the programming language is known as programming, and the person who writes the program is called a programmer.</p>

<p><h2>Types of Programming Languages</h2></p>
<p>There are several types of programming languages which can be categorized as follows:</p>

<p><h3>1. Low Level Language:</h3></p>
<p>Low-level languages are machine-dependent languages, which means that a program written for one type of system cannot be run on another system. A developer should have a detailed analysis and knowledge about the system for which they are going to write a program. Hence, programming in low-level languages is very much difficult and time-consuming. Different types of programming languages are:</p>

<p><h4>a. Machine Level Language (1GL):</h4></p>
<p>This language consists of a sequence of 0's and 1's to generate instructions. Since it uses binary numbers, this type of language is directly understood by the processor. So, it has a higher execution speed. It is also a machine-dependent language in which programmers should have detailed knowledge of the system.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>It is directly understood by the processor, so execution speed is relatively high.</p>
<p>Language translators or processors are not needed.</p>
<p>They can be used to program specific purpose computers.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult and time-consuming to develop and debug a program.</p>
<p>It is a machine-dependent language. So, a program developed for one system cannot be operated in another system.</p>
<p>All the syntax and commands are in the form of binary numbers, which is difficult to remember.</p>
<p>Programmers should have detailed knowledge about a particular system and its architecture.</p>

<p><h4>b. Assembly Language (2GL):</h4></p>
<p>Assembly language is also an example of low-level language. In this language, instead of writing instructions in the series of 0's and 1's, we can use mnemonics (symbolic instructions) like ADD, SUB, RST, DIV, MOD, and so on. Since it is closer to machine-level language, a programmer should have detailed knowledge about the computer's internal architecture. This language is faster in comparison to high-level language. Since this language is not directly understood by the computer, we need a language translator like an assembler to convert it into machine-level language.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>It is easier to write, debug, and understand programming written in assembly language compared to machine-level language.</p>
<p>Program execution is faster compared to high-level language.</p>
<p>Since they are machine-dependent, they are used to develop different device drivers.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<p>It is a machine-dependent language, i.e., a program made for one processor doesn’t run in another processor.</p>
<p>The use of mnemonics code makes assembly language much more complex.</p>
<p>Program development and debugging are more difficult and time-consuming compared to high-level language.</p>

<p><h3>2. High Level Language:</h3></p>
<p>This language is close to the English language. High-level language code is written in an English-like structure using mathematical notation. Since it is similar to the English language, it is easier to develop and debug the program. It is machine-independent (i.e., programs developed for one processor can work on another processor). Since HLL (High Level Language) is not directly understood by computers, we need a language processor or translator, such as a compiler and interpreter, to convert programs written in high-level language to machine-level language. FORTAN (Formula Translator), introduced in 1956, is the first high-level language. Nowadays, there are many high-level languages like C, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>Since it is closer to the English language, programs written in this language are easier to write, debug, and understand.</p>
<p>Since it is machine-independent, programs written for one processor can work on another processor.</p>
<p>Programmers don’t have to remember a large number of mnemonics and other unusual codes.</p>
<p>Program development is faster and requires less effort than other languages.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<p>Computers don’t understand high-level language directly. So the program needs conversion before execution.</p>
<p>Program execution is slower compared to low-level language.</p>

<p><h2>High Level Language can further be classified into:</h2></p>

<p><h3>a. Procedural Oriented Language (3GL):</h3></p>
<p>This type of language is a high-level language that primarily focuses on procedures rather than on data. Hence, they are used to express the logic and procedure of the program. Since it focuses only on procedure, it is complex and time-consuming to write a large program. This type of language follows a top-to-bottom approach, i.e., the main function is written at the bottom of the program. This type of language doesn’t have important and powerful features like data encapsulation, data inheritance, data extraction, and so on. So, this type of language has less security compared to object-oriented language. Examples: C, FORTRAN, QBasic, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>Program development and debugging are easier compared to low-level language.</p>
<p>More advanced and user-friendly software can be developed.</p>
<p>It is also a machine-independent language.</p>
<p>It is used for general-purpose programming.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<p>Language translator or processor is required to execute the program.</p>
<p>Program execution is slower.</p>
<p>Data security is less compared to other high-level languages.</p>

<p><h3>b. Problem/Object Oriented Language (4GL):</h3></p>
<p>This is the advanced form of high-level language which primarily focuses on data rather than procedure. It allows the user to specify what the output should be without describing all the details (i.e., procedure) of how the data should be manipulated. This type of language follows a bottom-up approach. That means all main functions are written at the bottom of the program, whereas classes and objects are described at the top of the program. Since it has several powerful features such as data encapsulation, data extraction, and inheritance, the data is more secure compared to procedural language. Examples: C#, C++, Java, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>Web-based applications and software can be developed.</p>
<p>More advanced and user-friendly software can be developed.</p>
<p>It is also machine-independent language.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<p>Language translator is required to execute the program.</p>
<p>Program execution is slower.</p>
<p>It is difficult to develop hardware-oriented languages.</p>

<p><h3>c. Natural Language (5GL):</h3></p>
<p>Natural language uses simple statements of common communication language, where we could write statements that would look like normal sentences. It is still in the developing stage; computer scientists are working hard on developing such language. However, programming languages like PROLOG (Programming Logic) are currently in use. For example: instead of writing some unusual code, programmers would write: “Who are the salesmen who have sold more than 30,000 products last month?”</p>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>It will be easier to develop and debug the program.</p>
<p>It will also be machine-independent</p>
