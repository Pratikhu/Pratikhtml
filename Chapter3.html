<p><h2>Software - Introduction:</h2></p>
<p>As we know stand alone hardware cannot do nothing, for the smooth operation of our Computer System there should be proper coordination between hardware and software. Software helps to mobilize the hardware and other resources. In order to mobilize hardware we have to write several set of instruction which instruct computer what to do, what not o. These set of instruction are collectively know as program and the term software is the collection of related programs and  associated documents. In Order to produce useful output, hardware and software must work together. Nothing useful can be done with the hardware only and software cannot be utilize without hardware. The different types of software are:</p>

<p><h2>System software:</h2></p>
<p>System software is set of one or more programs designed to control the operation of our computer system. This type of software doesn't fulfill the specific requirement of the user. They are general program written to assist human in the use of the computer system. In general system software support the running of other software, communicate with peripheral device, support the development of other types of software and monitors the use of various hardware resources. Thus, the system software makes the operation of the computer system more effective and efficient. The system software is categorized into two categories.</p>

<p><h2>System Management:</h2></p>
<p>It is responsible for proper management and functioning of the computers system. All types of management between computer hardware and software is performed by system management software. There are 3 types of system management software:</p>

<p><h2>Operating System:</h2></p>
<p>Operating system is a collection program that controls the overall operation of the computer system. It is the 1st program that is loaded into memory when the computer is turned on. It provides platform for other application program to run and execute. It provides user with an interface so that uses can easily communicate with computer. For example Linux, Windows, Mac etc.</p>

<p><h2>Utility software:</h2></p>
<p>It is the supporting software which is used to perform specific task related to the maintenance of the computer system. Some  of the utility software are included in operating system where as some are available as separate utility in market. They are also called service program. For example  Norton Utility, PC tools, win zip etc.</p>

<p><h2>Device driver:</h2></p>
<p>A device driver is a software which is responsible for smooth functioning of the hardware device that is connected to the computer. When we add a new  device to the computer, we need to install new software called device driver. Device driver will co-ordinate with the operating system and the newly installed hardware functions properly and smoothly.</p>

<p><h2>System Development:</h2></p>
<p>It refers to set of programs that are use to develop computer program. This type of software are not used by a normal user of the computes. They are used by programmers for the development of new program. There are two types of system development software:</p>

<p><h2>Programming language:</h2></p>
<p>The language with which we give instruction to the computer is known as programming language. Programming language are the set of different keywords, variable, operators, loops and other symbols etc. They help to make communication between computer and user. These are two types of programming language low level language and high level language.</p>

<p><h2>Language translator:</h2></p>
<p>It is a special kind computer software which translates the programs written one language in another language. It is compulsory for both low and high level language. It is also called language processor. The types of language translator are compiler, interpreter  and assembler.</p>

<p><h2>Application Software:</h2></p>
<p>Application software is a set of one or more program which are design to do a specific task. It is made to fulfill the user demand. This program directs a computer to solve user oriented problem such as preparing bills,  calculating mathematical equation, preparing mark sheet etc. The software that are develop for user purpose is called application software. These types of software are generally develop by using high level language. For example Ms-Excel, Photoshop, Billing software etc. There are two types of application software:</p>

<p><h2>Packaged software:</h2></p>
<p>They are the generalized set of programs design and develop for general purpose. It is generally large sized, error-free, advance and standard software with much more functionality for special work. This type of software doesn't perfectly match the requirement of many organization or user. They cannot be changed easily are developed and designed by reputed software Company so they are trustworthy. They are expensive for small organization. For example Ms-Office, Adobe, Macromedia etc.</p>

<p><h2>Customized / Tailored software:</h2></p>
<p>This is a software developed in high level language for special task. This type of software is developed for some specific purpose for solving specific problem of specific user or organization. The requirement on the user or organization can be perfectly matched. They can be changed easily since they are made by local programmers. For example: payroll system, inventory management, school management, billing software, mark sheet evaluation etc.</p>

<p><div><h1>Operating system - Introduction</h1></div></p>
<p>An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of programs that controls overall resources such as CPU, memory, input-output devices of the computer system. The major objective of operating system is to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager of a company, an operating system is responsible for the smooth and efficient functioning of the entire computer system. The operating system provides the platform for other application program/software to run and execute. It provides user with an interface so that user can easily communicate with computers, which is more convenient to use and operate.</p>

<p><div><h1>Functions / Features / Advantages of Operating System (OS)</h1></div></p>

<p><h2>Input-Output (I/O) Management:</h2></p>
<p>Input-Output is essential to operate any computer. It allows computer to interact with several peripheral devices such as keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner etc.</p>

<p><h2>User Interface (UI):</h2></p>
<p>User Interface means an ideal environment in which user can work on it so that s/he can interact with the computerized system. Every operating system provides the feature of user interface in order to enhance the experience and joy of using computer or any other computerized system. It acts as a bridge between user and computer. There are 2 types of user Interface:</p>

<p><h2>Character/Command User Interface (CUI):</h2></p>
<p>Eg MS-DOS</p>

<p><h2>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</h2></p>
<p>Eg Windows, MAC OS</p>

<p><h2>Security:</h2></p>
<p>The operating system of a computer has a number of built-in tools to protect against security threats such as viruses, unauthorized access, suspicious network activity etc. The basic security in an OS is to control access to your computer by setting users and passwords.</p>

<p><h2>Process Management:</h2></p>
<p>The process management allocates a processor to execute a chosen process. OS acts as a traffic controller, job scheduler, process scheduler, and dispatcher.</p>

<p><h2>Memory Management:</h2></p>
<p>Memory is a large array of bytes, each with its own address. When the user requests CPU for read-write operation, OS determines the amount of memory requ
