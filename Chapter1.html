            Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word "computere" which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as an input which are isolated and uninterpreted through input device, process it according to the requirement of the user or command supplied by the user, store it before and after processing of require and produce a meaningful information as an output through an output device. Generally, computer works on IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. The basic operation of computer is illustrated by following block diagram.

        <h2>Some characteristics/features of computer.</h2>
            <p>The implementation of computers are not only limited/confined to a small area rather they are used from simple domestic task to complex scientific research to engineering. The use of computer are increasing day-by-day due to some special features or characteristics that computer own. Several features of computer are:
            
            Accuracy: Computer are the accurate machine that means result produced by computer are 100% accurate. Since, it follows GIGO. The error that may arise in output is due to human not by a computer.
            Speed: Computer works on tremendously high speed. The operating speed of computer are measured in  millisecond, microsecond, picosecond and nanosecond which means computer can perform millions and billions of instruction per second.
            Storage: It is the area or unit which is capable of storing data and information for present and future use. Storing data allows users to retrieve it whenever required. These days computer comes with high volume of memory which are measured in Megabyte (1024 KB) , Gigabyte (1024 MB), Terabyte(1024 GB) and Petabyte(1024 TB).
            Versatility: Computer are generally design to serve more than one type of work. The implementation of computer are not only limited to specific purpose, they solve general requirement of the user and can be used in more than 1 type of job.
            Diligence: The feature of computer in which computer doesn't get tired even after working for long period of time. Computer can perform any number of task continuously until it is accomplished. Once the instruction is given computer follows the command till it gets terminated.
            Automatic: Computer is an automatic machine. Once the instruction is generated it perform accordingly until command is terminated. We don't have to issue continuous command in order to operate the computer. This is called automatic.</p>

<h2>Applications/Implementations/Uses of computer</h2>
<p>
    The uses of computer are increased day by day. Every aspect if human life is highly influenced by computer. From simple domestic use to complex engineering and scientific solutions, computer can be used. This is due to the versatility of computer. Some of the basic implementation of computer are:

Education: Nowadays, computer are highly used in teaching and learning process. Many interesting graphics can be made and provided for easy learning. Also, computer provide features of internet which make learning easy and fun.
Communication: Computer is massively used in communication. Communication is done by e-mail, chat, online conferencing. e-fax etc with help of internet in computer. It has made the communication faster, easier and cheaper.
Business: In business sector, computer are used to generate invoice, maintain stock and make statistical analysis. E-commerce is the new and emerging way of buying and selling goods and service through used of electronic means and media.
Engineering and designing: Scientific and engineering design requires complex and massive computations. Design of bridges, towers, buildings, generators, motors, electrical transmission etc requires precise computation which are done through computers.

<h2>Generations of computer.</h2>
<p>
    History of computers dates back to mechanical era where computer were not used for general purpose. It takes long period of time to come to this phase. Development of computer had passed through different era from mechanical to electro mechanical to digital computer. The development in different electronic components, precise engineering and hi-tech technology has change the operation of computer drastically. Earlier computer were only used for specific purpose such as counting and performing basic mathematical operation. Later on, due to the necessity and requirement of user different general purpose computer were developed. Therefore, the classification of computer on the basis of major electronic component, their architecture and modes of operation is known as generations of computer. Five different generations of computer are listed below along with their distinct features.
    <br>
   <h3> 1. First generations computer (1946-1958 )</h3>
    
    <p>They used vacuum tubes as their basic electronic components used to control and amplify electronic signals.
    They were big in size, consume more electricity and generate large amount of heat thus required air conditioning system to keep device cool.
    They were unreliable and were prone to frequent hardware failure.
    They were normally not used for commercial purpose.
    Machine level language was used to program these computers.
    eg: ENIAC, EDVAC, EDSAC, UNIVAC<br></p>
    
    <h3>2. Second generations computer (1959-1964 )</h3>
    
    <p>They used transistors as their basic electronic components.
    They were small in size as compared to first generation thus consume less electricity and generate less heat.
    They were less prone to hardware failure thus more reliable.
    They were not also for commercial purpose because production was difficult and costly.
    Assembly language were used to program these computers.
    eg: IBM 7000, IBM 1401, IBM 1620, NCR 304, MARK III, ATLAS<br></p>
    
    [Note: First computer brought in Nepal was IBM 1401 for population census of 2028 BS]
     <br>
    
     <h3>3.Third generations computer ( 1965-1974 )</h3>
    
    <p>They used Integrated Circuits (IC) as their basic electronic components.
    They were smaller in size, consume less electricity and generate less amount of heat.
    They were faster and more reliable compared to first and second generations.
    They were widely used for the commercial application all over the world.
    High level language were used to program these computers.
    eg: PDP-8, PDP-11, ICL 2900 series, IBM 360, IBM 370</p>

    <h3>4. Fourth generation computer (1975-1990)</h3>
    
<p>They use VLSI ( Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits ) as their main electronic components.
    There size were drastically reduced and hence were they were much more portable.
    They were faster in processing and were much more reliable.
    They have larger memory up to GB and TB.
    They use different advance high level language to program this computer.
    eg: Apple Macintosh,  IBM PC<br></p>
    
    <h3>5. Fifth generation computer (1990-onwards)</h3>
    
<p>They use ULSIC (Ultra Large Scale Integrated Circuit) or Microprocessor as their major electronic components.
    They have or will have artificial intelligence.
    They have tremendously high processing unit due to parallel processing.
    They are capable of image processing, speech or voice recognition.
    They use different high level language to program this computer.</p></p>
