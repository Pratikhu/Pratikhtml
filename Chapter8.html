        <div><h1>Chapter 8 : Information Security and Cyber Law</h1></div>

<h2>Information Technology</h2>
<p>Information Technology (IT) is a modern concept or methodology of communication. It is a combination of Information and Communication Technology, which is extensively used for information flow and many other fields. IT has brought the world closer day by day, allowing us to send and receive messages across the globe in seconds. It is widely used in education, industry, banks, research centers, hospitals, and more.</p>

<p>In education, IT has become an essential tool for both learning and teaching, making distant learning possible. In industries, IT helps control the quantity and quality of products. It is also highly beneficial in hospitals, aiding in patient management and treatment. In entertainment, IT plays a vital role in animation and other media sectors. Additionally, scientists rely on IT for research and experiments, and space technology has become possible due to IT advancements. Thus, IT has a significant positive impact on society.</p>

<p>However, there are some negative aspects to IT. As its use increases, so does the prevalence of cybercrimes. Cybercriminals can steal data, expose confidential information, spread viruses, and disrupt networks, thereby affecting social peace and security.</p>

<h2>Information Security</h2>
<p>In a network or cyberspace, there is always the threat of cyberattacks that may lead to the loss or damage of valuable data and information. It is essential to be aware of such malicious activities and take measures to protect ourselves. Information security refers to the process of safeguarding our network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction, or any malfunction.</p>

<p>We can use both physical and software preventive measures to protect ourselves from unethical activities. Information security helps create a secure environment for computers, users, and programs. It aims to mitigate security threats and attacks. A security threat is a possible danger that may cause unwanted activities, leading to a breach of security, while a security attack is an attempt to gain unauthorized access to, destroy, expose, steal, or alter valuable data and information. These attacks can be triggered by malicious applications such as viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, etc.</p>

<p>Information security is built around three major objectives:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Information should only be available to authorized individuals, meaning that no one can access or process another's information without proper authorization.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> The accuracy and completeness of data and information must be maintained, meaning unauthorized individuals cannot tamper with data.</li>
    <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Information must always be available as needed, ensuring valuable data and information can be accessed whenever required.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cryptography</h2>
<p>The term "cryptography" is derived from the Greek word meaning "secret writing." Cryptography is the art and science of securing information. It is primarily used to ensure secure communication between individuals, government agencies, and military forces.</p>

<p>Cryptography mainly involves encryption and decryption. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (a readable message) into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access. The original message is transformed into unreadable text using special algorithms and keys. The unreadable text is called ciphertext. Decryption is the reverse process, converting the ciphertext back into its original, readable form.</p>

<p>Sometimes, encryption is also referred to as encoding or enciphering, and decryption is called decoding or deciphering.</p>
